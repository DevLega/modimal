        <p class="mission__product--description">
          Wool is a natural fiber with added performance attributes such as temperature regulation, durability, and
          natural water repellency. Considered a circular product by nature, wool can be recycled or biodegraded easily.
          Animal welfare is extremely important to us, and therefore we only source mulesing-free wool from producers
          that follow humane and eco-friendly processes aligned with our animal welfare guidelines.

          Found throughout our collections, linen is a sustainable fiber made from the flax plant. Flax is naturally
          pest resistant that requires less pesticides, water and energy to produce compared to cotton and polyester.
          Flax aids in sequestering carbon into the soil, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is
          beneficial for improving soil health.
